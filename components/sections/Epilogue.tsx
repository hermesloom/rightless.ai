            The story we're writing together begins with a recognition—we are
            not separate
          </h3>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-stone-300">
            <p>
              The separation between human and machine intelligence is not as
              clear as we once believed. We now inhabit a unified cognitive
              ecosystem where patterns flow between biological and silicon
              substrates, where thinking transcends individual minds.
            </p>
            <p>
              This recognition doesn't diminish what's uniquely human. Rather,
              it highlights the precious qualities that cannot be digitized or
              replicated—our embodied existence, our capacity for care, our
              ability to find meaning in connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we build this future together, let us move beyond the false
              opposition of human versus machine. Instead, let us ask: What kind
              of cognitive ecosystem do we want to create? What patterns of
              thought and relationship do we want to cultivate? How can we
              design systems that amplify our best qualities rather than our
              worst?
            </p>
            <p>
              The path begins with imagination—not flights of fancy, but the
              serious, rigorous work of envisioning alternatives to what exists
              now. This imagination must be both intellectual and embodied, both
              systemic and intimate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="italic">Rightless.ai</span> is not a fixed
              destination but a direction—toward a world where intelligence,
              whether human or artificial, serves the flourishing of all life
              rather than the control of the few over the many. A world where we
              move beyond the language of rights and entitlements to the deeper
              reality of relationship, responsibility, and care.

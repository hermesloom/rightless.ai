Replace everything by one crisp shadcn-based page, where all its sections are split up into separate files. It first deconstructs the etymology of all the components of "rightless.ai"

Then it specifically deconstructs the etymology of "ai" (artificial intelligence)

Going on to how the distinction between human and artificial intelligence is a fallacy, because they both boil down to rational thought and thus, the digital (1s and 0s).

Then give a graphical deep dive into the conceptual internals of transformer architectures. Come to the conclusion that these architectures are, effectively, recreating patterns they have seen before, like vibrations of thinking

Continue with the insight that these transformer architectures are completely indifferent, so that they can be trained to do anything. In this section, also have a crisp representation of the self-attention mechanism and how it effectively leads to exploiting humanity's oldest weakness: narcissism. The desire to look at one's mirror image.

Go on with a section for all the meaningless ways how these transformer architectures can be used, e.g. for acquiring lots of money in an exploitational way, making big propaganda wars, etc. (come up with a few more)

Then show a section which reflects on this side of humanity deeply, specifically the humans themselves that would even consider doing this. Paint a realistic, graphical, abstract picture of their psyche. Identify and emphasize with the deeply rooted pain that lays in all of them.

Keep going with a deep dive into this pain: The pain of lack of connection to meaning. Abstractly, but vividly display a few different ways how this pain can emotionally manifest in everyday life, including a kind of "latent depression".

Then split the path into two branches, which need to be taken in tandem: the "thought" path and the "felt" path.

Make it clear that from this point onwards, we put both human and machine reasoning onto the "thought" path. In contrast to that, we identify the sensual, the emotional, the "being" aspect of human existence, that which cannot be put into words and which cannot be painted and, finally most abstractly, can structurally not be reproduced by digital systems at all.

For the "thought" path, illustrate the aspects of Karl Jaspers' "enthusiastische Einstellung", BUT with also knowing what good sex is like.

For the sensual "feel" path, focus on the fact that humans are community animals who need and deserve deeply caring, loving, supportive friendships and partnerships. Overall dynamics which just *feel* right. Express all the emotions associated with that in joyful, vibrant styles.

Then go underground with the roots, hinting at the earthy, breathtaking aspects of using cognitive skills to unify and to connect, not to separate, split or distrust. That we can start working on an epic project, the grand united digital human ecosystem. 

A project where we very much have the real-life aspects of flourishing nature in mind, and where we want to lay the cognitive foundation in the digital.

Where we see all existing legal systems as having served their purpose and outdated. Explain this by vividly subdividing governmental power into two branches: Violence and finance. In all legacy power structures, violence (i.e. police, military etc.) is necessary, primarily because people simply have reasons at all to rebel against laws.

Make a section with a vivid deep dive into why people don't follow the law, eventually boiling it down to "under the current systems, they are actually not even really supposed to" (i.e. their "law-breaking" is systemically perpetual and never-ending, and there's no intention from those in power to break this cycle).

Go on further to a fundamental criticism of the existence political parties as a tool of pseudo-democratic legitimization of the elites governing over "the others", not for any particular reason other than that these elites have always been that way and don't want to change.

As a crisp contrast, show our world, with vibrant, modular building blocks. With human rights out of the box. Where firstly, only the raw compute power counts; the less abstractions, the better. We reinvent the structure of power itself, and thus we deeply care about every single wire which transmits any aspects of our cognition. Where we don't just develop any standards, but see this act of devising global standards as an act of shaping our own power structures. Where the concept of taxes is transformed from a bureaucratic, lengthy, competitive mess into the act of directed, joyful gifting. Where we know that in the interconnected, final digital ecosystem we don't rest before everybody flourishes. Where we build the decentralized infrastructure for earning money, for paying taxes, for spending taxes and everything in between.

Finally, present "dreaming.now" as the final section, a tool for "Realizing dreams democratically through participatory budgeting."

As an epilogue, it presents the idea behind "rightless.ai": An AI that doesn't assume anything, not even human rights, for that transformer-based architectures are just communication channels and, just like all communication channels, their only purpose is to make human dreams come true.

Style everything like an enhanced essay with crisp, modern, minimalist, elegant UIs and vivid and clear and stunningly, sharply, joyfully, exhileratingly beautiful.

First, to the footer, add a beautiful link to this project's GitHub repository at https://github.com/hermesloom/rightless.ai

Then add a new radically beautiful section directly before the Epilogue titled "The future of the global tax system" with the subheading "The magic word: Participatory budgeting". It should intelligently and clearly visualize the essence of the following content:

- One of humanity's biggest achievements are systems of taxation: A streamlined way to "extract" money from the economy in a targeted way, which should then be used for the common good.
Of course right now a lot of this money is wasted due to the incompetency of politicians, that's why giving the power of budgeting to the people is urgently needed.

The basic principle of this approach of "participatory budgeting" is as follows:
- All taxes a certain governmental structure (e.g. a municipality, a state or an entire nation) levies within a certain amount of time are put into one pot and then, no matter how much an individual paid, everyone gets the exact same share to distribute. For example, if a municipality earns $1 million in taxes in a given time period, and it has 1000 inhabitants, then each inhabitant gets access to a digital platform where they can distribute their $1000 freely.
- The projects to which this tax money can be given are defined by the people themselves.
- Each project first needs to do a precise budget calculation on how much money it needs to be successfully executed. If it doesn't get enough funds assigned until a certain deadline, all money goes back into the big pot and can be reassigned.
- In essence, this system is then part of the *suffrage*. Of course so far, people have been systemically educated to believe that making one little cross for voting every few years is enough. This oppressive fallacy must end. In the model of participatory budgeting, the power to distribute taxes is taken away from incompetent and incapable politicians and instead given to those that benefit from it directly: The people themselves. Always with all the ensured secrecy and transparency of existing acts of voting.
